# Enterprise SaaS Playbook

This repository is a **practical, experience-driven playbook** for designing, building, operating, and scaling **enterprise-grade SaaS applications** — from initial idea to production, compliance, and long-term evolution.

It is not a theoretical guide.
It reflects **real-world engineering decisions**, trade-offs, and practices required to run **secure, reliable, audit-ready SaaS platforms** in regulated and high-scale environments.

The playbook is intended for:

* Senior / Staff / Principal engineers
* SaaS founders and technical leaders
* Platform, backend, and full-stack engineers
* Teams building production systems with compliance and reliability requirements

## What This Playbook Covers

The documents are organized to follow the **natural lifecycle of an enterprise SaaS product** — from vision to operations to future-proofing.

Each section can be read independently, but together they form a complete system view.
