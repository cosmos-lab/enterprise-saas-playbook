# 14 – SaaS Compliance and Regulatory Readiness

This document outlines the **baseline compliance, privacy, and security expectations** for a SaaS product as it grows from MVP to enterprise-ready. The focus is on *practical readiness* — knowing what to implement, when to implement it, and how to demonstrate control maturity to customers and auditors.

Compliance is not a checkbox; it is an **operational discipline sustained over time**.

## 1. SOC 2 Type II Readiness

SOC 2 Type II evaluates how well security and operational controls are **designed and consistently operated over time**.

Key requirements:

* Define and document security policies (access control, change management, incident response)
* Enforce MFA and least-privilege access across systems
* Log and monitor system and user activity
* Run controls consistently for **6–12 months**
* Pass an independent third-party audit

SOC 2 readiness depends on operational consistency, not tooling alone.

## 2. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

GDPR focuses on protecting personal data and user rights.

Core obligations:

* Know what personal data is collected and why
* Collect data only for lawful, explicit purposes
* Allow users to access, delete, and export their data
* Sign Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with vendors
* Report eligible data breaches within **72 hours**

Privacy considerations must be embedded into product design.

---

## 3. CCPA / CPRA (California Privacy Regulations)

CCPA/CPRA emphasize transparency and consumer control over personal data.

Key requirements:

* Inform users what data is collected
* Allow data access and deletion requests
* Honor “Do Not Sell / Share My Data” requests
* Disclose vendors and data usage practices
* Secure personal data appropriately

Privacy notices must reflect actual system behavior.

---

## 4. Enterprise Security Controls

Baseline security controls expected by enterprise customers:

* MFA enforced across all critical systems
* SSO for employees and customers where applicable
* Encryption of data at rest and in transit
* Audit logs for critical actions
* Regular vulnerability scanning and remediation

These controls form the foundation of trust.

---

## 5. Incident Response Programs

An effective incident response capability includes:

* Rapid detection of security incidents
* Containment and remediation procedures
* Assessment of data and customer impact
* Notification of customers or regulators when required
* Documentation and continuous improvement of response processes

Preparedness reduces damage and builds credibility.

---

## 6. Staged Compliance Adoption

Recommended approach:

* MVP stage: design for compliance, minimal enforcement
* Growth stage: formalize policies and controls
* Enterprise stage: audits, certifications, and continuous compliance

Compliance maturity should align with business stage.

---

## 7. Summary

SaaS compliance readiness:

* Enables enterprise sales
* Reduces legal and operational risk
* Strengthens customer trust

Strong compliance posture is a competitive advantage, not just a requirement.
